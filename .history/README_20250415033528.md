# Event Management App

This is a custom-built **Event Management** application developed using **Microsoft PowerApps**. 
The app is a part of a larger tool suite that I have developed to streamline various office tasks and improve team collaboration. 

## App Overview

The **Event Management App** is designed to help users efficiently organize, manage, and attend events. Users can view upcoming and past events, register for them, and receive invites. This app is ideal for workplaces, teams, or organizations to schedule and track events seamlessly.

- **Event Title & Type**: Each event has a title, and it is categorized by its type (e.g., Meeting Type 1, Meeting Type 2, etc.), making it easy to identify the nature of the event at a glance.
- **Event Title & Type**: If you are an Admin then in the right navigation bar you will see Create event subitem, by clicking there a screen with a form will shows up, where admin can enter all information about the event and with submiting new event will be stored in sharepoint list and
