# Event Management App

This is a custom-built **Event Management** application developed using **Microsoft PowerApps**. 
The app is a part of a larger tool suite that I have developed to streamline various office tasks and improve team collaboration. 

## App Overview

The **Event Management App** is designed to help users efficiently organize, manage, and attend events. Users can view upcoming and past events, register for them, and receive invites. This app is ideal for workplaces, teams, or organizations to schedule and track events seamlessly.

### Key Features:

- **Upcoming Events, Past Events, All Events**: The app allows users to toggle between different event categories. You can view all events, upcoming events, or past events, making it easy to track and stay updated.
- **Event Card**: Each event has a title, and it is categorized by its type (e.g., Meeting Type 1, Meeting Type 2, etc.), making it easy to identify the nature of the event at a glance. All the informations is pooled from the sharepoint list.
- **Create Event**: If you are an Admin, you'll find the Create Event option in the right navigation bar. Clicking on it will open a form where you can input all the necessary details about the event. Once submitted, the new event will be stored in a SharePoint list and automatically created in the Outlook calendar.
- **Event Registration**: For each event, users can register if it is an external event or click to **Get Invite**, then Power automate will forward the event link. This functionality makes it easy to join events with just one click.
- **Subscription Management**: Users can manage their subscriptions to different event types, ensuring they only get notified about the events that matter most to them. In the navigation bar users can click on manage my suscription and add themselves there.
The Admin of them app, after creating an event can click anytime on inviting subscribers, if that is clicked the button will disapear. 
- **Event Details**: The app shows detailed information about each event, including the event's date and time, along with buttons to register or get the invite. If the event is in the past then instead of get invite button view slide or watch recording will appear.
