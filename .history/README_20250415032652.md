# Event Management App

This is a custom-built **Event Management** application developed using **Microsoft PowerApps**. 
The app is a part of a larger tool suite that I have developed to streamline various office tasks and improve team collaboration. 

## App Overview

The **Event Management App** is designed to help users efficiently organize, manage, and attend events. Users can view upcoming and past events, register for them, and receive invites. This app is ideal for workplaces, teams, or organizations to schedule and track events seamlessly.
